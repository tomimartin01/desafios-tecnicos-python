Generators are functions that returns an object that can be iterated over, they generate the items inside the object lazily
they are more memory efficient

syntaxis

def mygenerator():
    yield 1
    yield 2
    yield 3

g = mygenerator()

g is an generator object, you can iterate g with a for and get 1 2 3

value = next(g) return the value of the first yield, to print the second value add another next 

generator comprenhension 

mygenerator = (i for i in range(10) if i%2==0)
return a object that can be iterates with a simple for or can convert to a list
for i in my mygenerator:
    print(i)

g = list(mygenerator)
