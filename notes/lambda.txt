Lambda function is a small one line anonymous function that is defined without a name

Lambda are used for build simple functions thata are use only once in the doce or as an argument to another higher functions, functions that 
take in other functions as arguments like sorted, map, filter and reduce.
syntaxis

lambda arguments: expression
add10 = lambda x: x+10
mult = x,y: x+y

call the function

add10(5)

sorted a list of tuple by the second element

points2D_sorted = sorted(points2D , key = lambda x: x[1])

map function, modify all the elements of a list

b = map(lambda x: x*2, a) it returns a list, you have to convert to a list with list(b)
print(list(b))
b = [x*2 for x in a] same that before but easier

Filter return all the elements that are True

b = filter(lambda x: x%2==0, a) it returns a list, you have to convert to a list with list(b)
print(list(b))
b = [x for x in a if x%2==0]

Reduce applies a function to all the elements of a iterator and returns one element, you have to import the function

from functools import reduce
prod_a = reduce(lambda x,y: x*y, a) returns a int with the prod of all the elements
