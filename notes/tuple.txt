tuple is a collection data type that is ordered and inmutable. It is similar to list with a main  difference
to the tuple cannot be change after the creation.
A tuple is used for objects that belong together.
mytuple = ('max', '28','Boston') parenthesis are optional
mytuple = ('max') this is not a tuple, is a string
mytuple = ('max',) this is a tuple
mytuple = tuple(['max',]) create a tuple
mytuple = ()) create a empty tuple
mytuple[1] access the first element of a tuple 
mytuple[-1] access the last element of a tuple 
mytuple[1] = 'josh' ERROR the tuple is inmutable can not assign a value
for i in mytuple iterate the tuple, similar to list 
if 'banana' in mytuple check if  an item is in the tuple
len(mytuple) check how many items do you hacve in the tuple
my_tuple.count('o') count the quantity of element 'o' in the tuple 
mytuple.index('p') returns the index of an element in the tuple, error if not an element
my_list = list(mytuple) convert a tuple into list, it works viceverse too
a = mytuple[1:5] creates a new tuple with four elements, the zero element is the first elements of mytuple and the last element is the fifth of mytuple (slicing)
a = mytuple[:5] creates a new tuple with five elements, start at the beginning of mytuple
a = mytuple[:5] creates a new tuple with five elements, start at the end of mytuple
a = mytuple[::1] creates a new tuple from the beginning of tuple to the end from 1 to one
a = mytuple[::1] creates a new tuple from the beginning of tuple to the end with a step of 2 [1,3,5]
a = mytuple[::-1] creates a new tuple reverse, similar to mytuple.reverse()

mytuple = "max",26,"boston"
name, age, city = mytuple  unpacking a tuple 

mytuple = (1,2,3,4,5)
i1, *i2, i3 = mytuple  i2= [2,3,4] i1 =1 i3=5

sys.getsizeof(mytuple) number of bytes

A tuple is smaller than a list, is more efficient work with tuple when you are working with a large data
Also is more efficient iterates a tuple than a list
