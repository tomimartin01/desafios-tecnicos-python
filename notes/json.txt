json is JavaScript Object Notation. It's a lightweight data format that is used for data exchange.
Convert python to json is called encoding or serialization.
There is a library called json import json

Encoding
personJSON = json.dumps(person)
personJSON = json.dumps(person, indent=4) for the format and see down
personJSON = json.dumps(person, indent=4, separators=(';', ' =')) change the separators in the json, the first arg is the last separators
personJSON = json.dumps(person, indent=4, sort_keys =True) ordered the key json by alphabetic


Convert or dump into a file

with open('person.json','w') as file:
    json.dump(person, file)

with open('person.json','w') as file:
    json.dump(person, file, indent=4)

convert json to python, decoding or deserialization

person = json.loads(personJSON)

load from a json file
with open('person.json','r') as file:
    person = json.load(file)


can not convert a object to json, first you have to convert to a dict
