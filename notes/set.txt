Sets is a collection data type that is unordenered and mutable but do not allow duplicates elements (difference between tuple/lists)
It admits list, string, int, float

Create a Sets
myset = set() empty set
myset = {1,2,3}
myset = {'hello'} ---> {'e','l','h','o'}

Modify a set

myset.add(4) add an element
myset.remove(3) remove an element, if the element doesnt exist raises an error
myset.discard(3) remove an element, if the element doesnt exist NO raises an error
myset.clear() delete all elements but no the set
myset.pop() delete an arbitrary element

Iterate a set

for i in mytset:
    print(i)

Check if an element is in the set
 if 1 in myset

Union of sets
union_set = myset.union(yourset) without duplication

Intersection of sets
int_set = myset.intersection(yourset) without duplication

Difference of sets
diff = myset.difference(yourset) without duplication, it depends on the set you make the difference

Symmetric difference of sets (opposite to difference)
diff = myset.symmetric_difference(yourset) without duplication, it depends on the set you make the difference

Subset of sets (subconjunto)
diff = myset.issubset(yourset) without duplication, it depends on the set you make the difference, return boolean

Superset of sets (subconjunto)
diff = myset.issuperset(yourset) without duplication, it depends on the set you make the difference, return boolean

copy set

mydict = yourdict same point problem
mydict = yourdict.copy()
mydict = set(yourdict)

Frozen set is an inmutable version of a set

a = frozenset([1,22,34,4])
