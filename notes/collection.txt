Collections module implements special container data types and provides alternatives with some additional funnctionality compared 
to the general Bert and containers like dict, list and tuples.

Counter, namedtuple, OrderedDict, defaultdict, deque

Counter creates a dictionary with the key of char without duplicates and the values is how many times appears the char
first you have to import the package
from collections import Counter
a ='aaaaabbcc'
count = Counter()
print(count) Counter({'a':5,'b':2,'c':2})
print(count.most_common(1)) returns a tuple with the key as the element and the value as how many times it appears
print(count.most_common(1)) returns a list of 2 tuple with the key as the element and the value as how many times it appears
print(count.elements()) get a list with all the elements 

namedtuple similar to create an object
from collections import namedtuple
Point = namedtuple('Point','x,y')
pt = Point(1,-4) Point(x=1, y=-4)
print(pt, pt.x,pt.y)


OrderedDict similar to a dict but remebers the ordered that the elements were inserted
In python 3.7 the dict can remember the ordered, so no one uses it

defaultdict similar to a dict but the only difference is that it have a default valueand the dictionary have a data type 

deque is a double ended queue, can add or remove elements from both sides.
from collections import deque
d = deque()
d.append(1)
d.append(2)
d.appendleft(3)
d.pop()
d.popleft()
d.clear()
d.extend(4,5,6) add multiple values
d.extendleft(4,5,6)
