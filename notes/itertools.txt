The inner tools module is a collection of tools for handling iterators. Iterators are data types that can be used in a for loop, like lists

product will compute the cartesian product of the input iterables
from itertools import product
a = [1,2]
b = [3,4]
prod = product(a,b) 
print(list(prod)) [(1,3),(1,4),(2,3),(2,4)]

permutations create all the possible orders of the iterator 
from itertools import permutations
a = [1,2,3]
prod = permutations(a,b) 
print(list(prod)) [(1,2,3),(2,3,1),(2,1,3),(1,3,2)..]

combinations create all the possible combinations with a specific lenght

accumulation sums the numbers of the iterator 

groupby order by a condition

from itertools import groupby 

def smaller_than_3(x):
     return x < 3

a = [1,2,3,4]

group_obj = groupby(a, key = lamba x: x<3 )
group_obj = groupby(a, key = smaller_than_3)
for key, value in group_obj:
    print(key, list(value)) True [1,2]  False [3,4]


count creates a inf count from a started num 
for i in count(10)

cycle creates a cycle of a iterator until a condition breaks it
a = [1,2,3]
for i in cicle(a)

repeat a number 

for i in repeat(1)
for i in repeat(1,4) repeats the 1 four times
